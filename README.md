# How to make and run an app container using Docker

Goal is to learn how to prepare [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) environment for interacting with apps, built an image and run it as a container with the ExampleApp using [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) cluster. 

## What is Docker?

Docker is an open platform for developing, running and organize applications. The core advantage of Docker is reducing time between program developing and running it in production. By using Docker developer has a possibility for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly without using external infrastructure.

Docker provides the ability to packing, testing, deploying and running an application in a loosely isolated environment called a container. Container used along with virtual machines which is and abstraction of actual hardware turning one server into many servers. Each virtual machine provides an operating system and necessary libraries.

## What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes is an open-source platform for managing and configuring containers. Kubernetes brings a framework to run distributed systems and helps with scaling and failover for an application, provides deployment patterns and so on.

To start a Kubernetes single-node cluster check the box **Enable Kubernetes** in Settings of Docker.

To learn more about Kubernetes [follow here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/).

## Step 1. Get the Docker

[Download](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) the latest Docker release and install it.

Have a look at step-by-step tutorial to customise it for [Mac](https://www.docker.com/docker-desktop/getting-started-for-mac) and [Windows](https://www.docker.com/docker-desktop/getting-started-for-windows).

## Step 2. Make a directory structure

First, create a root directory **quickstart_docker**. 

Next, create subdirectories **application** and **docker** inside of it. Put **application** in the **docker** folder. 

To do this, type at the command line:
```
mkdir quickstart_docker
mkdir quickstart_docker/application
mkdir quickstart_docker/docker
mkdir quickstart_docker/docker/application
```

Now the tree looks like this:
```
├── quickstart_docker
    ├── application
    ├── docker
      └── application
```

## Step 3. Compose an app

Write down the following code in any text editor and name it **application.py**. This app will simply recieve requests on 8000 port.

```
import http.server
import socketserver
PORT = 8000
Handler = http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler
httpd = socketserver.TCPServer(("", PORT), Handler)
print("serving at port", PORT)
httpd.serve_forever()
```

Place **application.py** file into **quickstart_docker/application** folder.

## Step 4. Create a Dockerfile

Dockerfile is a set of instructions for building a Docker image. A Docker image is a file that allow to execute code in a Docker container. 

First, create Dockerfile into **quickstart_docker/docker/application** directory with following containment:

```

FROM python:3.5                         #1 
WORKDIR /app                            #2 
COPY ./application /app                 #3
EXPOSE 8000                             #4
CMD ["python", "/app/application.py"]   #5

#1 Use base image from the registry
#2 Set the working directory to /app
#3 Copy the 'application' directory contents into the container at /app
#4 Make port 8000 available to the world outside this container
#5 Execute 'python /app/application.py' when container launches

```

## Step 5. Make a Docker image

Next step is to create a Docker image by using **docker build** command.

To do this, type at the command line:

```
docker build . -f docker/application/Dockerfile -t exampleapp

```

Where **.** is a working directory, **-f docker/application/Dockerfile** is the Dockerfile itself,  **-t exampleapp** is a name for searching.

Check Docker images list, to do this, type at the command line:

```
docker images
```

| REPOSITORY | TAG    | IMAGE ID     | CREATED       | SIZE   |
|------------|--------|--------------|---------------|--------|
| exampleapp | latest | 83wse0edc28a | 2 seconds ago | 153 MB |
| python     | 3.6    | 05sob8636w3f | 6 weeks ago   | 153 MB |

## Step 6. Run the container

Run the Exampleapp container by typing at the command line:

```
docker run exampleapp
```
