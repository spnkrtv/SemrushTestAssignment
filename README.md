# How to make and run an app container using Docker

This guide gives a short overview of the technology and provides an example of running an application in the Docker system. 

## What is Docker?

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is a platform for developing, running and deploying applications. The core advantage of Docker is reducing time between program development and delivery. By using Docker a developer is able to ship, test and deliver code quickly without using an external infrastructure. 

Docker provides the ability to isolate an application in an environment called a container.

## What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes is open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Kubernetes brings a framework to run distributed systems and helps with scaling and failover for an application, provides deployment patterns etc.

To start a Kubernetes single-node cluster, check the box **Enable Kubernetes** in Settings of Docker.

## Step 1. Get Docker

[Download](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) the latest Docker release and install it.

## Step 2. Create project structure

First, create a root directory `quickstart_docker`. 

Next, create subdirectories `application` and `docker` inside it. Put `application` in the `docker` folder. 

To do this, open terminal, navigate to a desired folder and type into the command line:
```
mkdir quickstart_docker
mkdir quickstart_docker/application
mkdir quickstart_docker/docker
mkdir quickstart_docker/docker/application
```

The project structure become as follows:
```
├── quickstart_docker
    ├── application
    ├── docker
        └── application
```

## Step 3. Compose an app

Prepare an app to operate with. This example app is a simple web server written in Python. The app it will be executable in a container.

Put the following code into `quickstart_docker/application/application.py` file:

```
import http.server
import socketserver
PORT = 8000
Handler = http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler
httpd = socketserver.TCPServer(("", PORT), Handler)
print("serving at port", PORT)
httpd.serve_forever()
```

## Step 4. Create Dockerfile

Dockerfile is a set of instructions for building Docker image. The act of running a Docker image creates a Docker container.

Put the following code in Dockerfile into `quickstart_docker/docker/application/Dockerfile` file:

```
FROM python:3.5                         #1 
WORKDIR /app                            #2 
COPY ./application /app                 #3
EXPOSE 8000                             #4
CMD ["python", "/app/application.py"]   #5
```

1. Use Python from a public [repository](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/repos/)
2. Set the working directory to `/app`
3. Copy the `application` directory contents into the container at `/app`
4. Make port 8000 available to the world outside this container
5. Execute `python /app/application.py` in the working directory when the container launches


## Step 5. Build Docker image

The next step is to create Docker image by using `docker build` command.

To do this, type into the command line:

```
docker build . -f docker/application/Dockerfile -t exampleapp
```

Where `.` is a working directory, `-f docker/application/Dockerfile` is the Dockerfile itself,  `-t exampleapp` is the image name.

Check created Docker images list by executing the command:

```
docker images
```

| REPOSITORY | TAG    | IMAGE ID     | CREATED       | SIZE   |
|------------|--------|--------------|---------------|--------|
| exampleapp | latest | 83wse0edc28a | 2 seconds ago | 153 MB |
| python     | 3.6    | 05sob8636w3f | 6 weeks ago   | 153 MB |

To learn more about Docker imaging, [follow here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/).

## Step 6. Run the container

The final step is to check the running container.

Run the Exampleapp container by typing into the command line:

```
docker run exampleapp
```
